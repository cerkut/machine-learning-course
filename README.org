=Machine Learning=, as a tool for =Artificial Intelligence=, is one of
the most widely adopted scientific fields. A considerable amount of
literature has been published on Machine Learning. The purpose of this
project is to provide the most important aspects of =Machine Learning=
by presenting a series of simple and yet comprehensive tutorials using
=Python=. In this project, we built our tutorials using many different
well-known Machine Learning frameworks such as =Scikit-learn=. In this
project you will learn:

- What is the definition of Machine Learning?
- When it started and what is the trending evolution?
- What are the Machine Learning categories and subcategories?
- What are the mostly used Machine Learning algorithms and how to
  implement them?

** Pull Request Process
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: pull-request-process
   :END:

Please consider the following criterions in order to help us in a better
way:

1. The pull request is mainly expected to be a link suggestion.
2. Please make sure your suggested resources are not obsolete or broken.
3. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end
   of the layer when doing a build and creating a pull request.
4. Add comments with details of changes to the interface, this includes
   new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and
   container parameters.
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at
   least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do
   that, you may request the owner to merge it for you if you believe
   all checks are passed.
